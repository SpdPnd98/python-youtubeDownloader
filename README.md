# Python Youtube Downloader

Disclaimer: The downloader logic is refered from [Stokry](https://dev.to/stokry/download-youtube-video-to-mp3-with-python-26p), check out his written article.

I mainly updated the code to fit my use case.

## How to use:

1. Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make a folder called `output` in your current directory
3. Add links to youtube videos you'd like to download as mp3 in `links.json`. Feel free to remove my personal playlist and add your own URLs.
4. In the root directory, run the following:

```
python download.py
```

Enjoy!
